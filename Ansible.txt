Ansible
--------

configiguration tool
		Ex: creating users in multiple servers
			updatin packages in multiple servers
			creating files in multiple servers comes under configuration.

some of configiguration tools are 

	Ansible -- playbook
	puppet -- manifesto
	chef


* Ansible unique feature is Push method. --> python must be installed in clints.

* Puppet and chef are pull methods (Agent will check every time in master if any updates available or not)


Desired state: server should have user1 and user2, nginx web server should be installed.
				in desired state if we delete some files or settings it will retrive the all files and settings when its run.

Ansible Installation
--------------------
* first we have to install 3 server.
1) controller (server)
2) clint1
3) clint2

*we have to set passwd for root for all 3 servers

*login to controller server

*install ansible in controller server


$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt install ansible
	


commands
--------

sudo su -

passwd

*set password for all three servers and enable paswordAuthentication

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

	PermitRootLogin yes
	paswordAuthentication yes
	
service sshd restart

* do for three servers


* set hostname for all three servers

	vi /etc/hostname
*change hostname for all three servers.

* add hosts

	vi /etc/hosts
* remove all content add below content.
	ex: private Ip		controller.local	controller
	
*add same as three servers


* Generate key in controller server.

		ssh-keygen
		
* then copy the key in all servers
	
		ssh-copy-id	root@clint
		
* it will copy the key in clint server now check whether it is login or not.

	ssh root@clint
	
* do for clint2 server also.

*create hosts
    
	ex:- vi hosts
			[servers]
			controller
			clint1
			clint2


ad hoc commands
----------------

* ansible -i hosts -m ping all

* ansible -i hosts -a uptime all

* ansible -i hosts -a "useradd Jeelan" clint1 (it will create the user in clint1)

* ansible -i hosts -a "userdel Jeelan" clint1 (it will delete the user in clint1)

* ansible -i hosts -a "cat /etc/passwd" clint1 (we can see the user in clint1)


ansible-playbook -i hosts plabook.yml --syntax-check




* ansible -i hosts all -m ping

* ansible -i hosts all -m ping -f 1

* ansible -i hosts all -m command -a hostname

* ansible -i hosts all -m command -a uptime

* ansible -i hosts all -m command -a free

* ansible -i hosts all -m command -a df -h

* ansible app -s -a "yum install -y docker-engine"

* ansible -i hosts all -a "cat /etc/passwd"

* ansible -i hosts all -m user -a "user=Jeelan password=jeelan"

* ansible web -m copy -a "src=/opt/text.txt dest=/tmp/text.txt"



we have multiple servers in hosts file.
	ex:
	
		[web]
		controller(server)
		[app]
		clint1
		[db]
		clint2
	
	ansible -i hosts web -a uptime
	*it will print web servers uptime
	
	ansible -i hosts web:app -a uptime
	*it will print web and app servers uptime
	
	ansible -i hosts web:app:db -a uptime
	*it will print web and app and db servers uptime

	* web i have multiple servers i need to see 1st two servers uptime.
	ansible -i hosts web[0:2] -a uptime
